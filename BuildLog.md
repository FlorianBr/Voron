# The Frame

Mostly according to the documentation. Instead of Misumi profiles I used ITEM profiles and ITEM standard fasteners. Mostly works without problems, but some parts need minor modifications.

All screws are secured with Loctite Medium.

# The Feet

The four feet in the corners with steppers. All parts are printed with black or red ASA.

# Controllers

View from the bottom with the wiring and controller boards.
The Octopus Pro can power the Raspberry Pi directly, no need for an additional 5V PSU.
I also have the Raspi connected twice to the Controller, with USB as well as serial.
